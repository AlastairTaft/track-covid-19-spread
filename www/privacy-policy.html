  <p>
    We collect your location history in the background while your app is not 
    running. We do not store any personal information linked to this location
    data.
  </p>

  <p>
    To know which data belongs to you we use a unique app installation id. This
    means there is a direct link to the location data we track and your specific
    app installation. If you uninstall the app, this link is severed.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are COVID-19 positive we use your location data to inform others that
    have crossed paths with you and that may be at risk.
  <p>

  <p>
    If you are not COVID-19 positive we use your data to cross reference against
    known at risk location points to inform you if you are at risk or not.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your data is private, it will never be passed on to a third
    party. It will never be sold.
  </p>

  <p>
    Location data may be shared with Government agencies to responsibly aid
    in contact tracing and preventing virus spread.
