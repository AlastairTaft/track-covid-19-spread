  <p>
    One of the most useful tools we have in limiting the spread of the virus is 
    contact tracing. If we can quickly inform those who are at risk of 
    unknowingly contracting the virus, those individuals can take precautions 
    to prevent passing it on to others. Speed is an advantage.

  <h2>What is it?</h2>

  <img src="./img/example-screenshot.gif" alt="example" height="300"/>
  <p>
    <strong>TAS Trace Together</strong> is an app built to aid community contact 
    tracing. It was built with Tasmania in-mind as being the target audience. But
    there's no reason it can't be used elsewhere. Or 
    <a href="https://github.com/AlastairTaft/APITasTraceTogether">the</a> 
    <a href="https://github.com/AlastairTaft/TasTraceTogether">code</a> can be 
    forked and used by other developers in other regions.
  </p>

  <h2>Where can I get it?</h2>
  <p>
    Both the Apple store and Google Play store are not accepting submissions 
    relating to COVID-19 to limit the spread of misinformation. Therefore
    at the moment it's only possible to download and install directly for 
    Android, link below.

    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <p>
    It tracks your location anonymously. If you have been diagnosed with 
    COVID-19, you can report this through the app. Anyone who has been in the 
    same place, at the same time, while you are potentially infectious and who 
    is also using the app will be informed. They can then take precautions to
    limit the spread, such as self isolating.

  <h2>Inspiration</h2>
  <p>The work for this app started out as a solution for a global hackathon 
    where developers got together to work on solutions for the COVID-19 crisis.
    You can see the original webpage for that submission 
    <a href="./covid-19-global-hackathon.html">here</a> and you can see other
    fantastic solutions <a href="https://covid-global-hackathon.devpost.com/submissions">here</a>
