# What is it?
An API to query the location data for COVID-19 diagnosed cases. Built during the [COVID-19 Global Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/test-test-test-test-123)

This project pivoted to a contact tracing [app](https://github.com/AlastairTaft/TasTraceTogether) and [backend](https://github.com/AlastairTaft/APITasTraceTogether).

# Why
Tracking the spread of the virus is immensly valuable. But if everyone rolls their own solution for collecting this data its value is diminished. By being API only we make the data set easy to access and easy to contribute too. Giving other devs a head start on their solution building.

To kick things off we've provided [a simple website](https://www.trackcovid19spread.com) any COVID-19 positive users can use to anonymously submit their location data to help track the spread. 

# API 
Please use our API to get COVID-19 patient's historic location data or to submit location history. Use it ethically to build solutions to help fight the virus. Please share it, let's build a single source of truth with critical mass.

Alternatively feel free to fork this if you need to roll your own solution.
