# Help track the spread. Anonymously submit your location history. Fight the virus. ðŸ’ª

## What can you do to help?
If you have been diagnosed with the corona virus visit [trackcovid19spread.com](https://www.trackcovid19spread.com) and submit your recent location data.

## Is it anonymous? 
Your data is anonymised before it reaches our servers. And we don't ask you to login to any accounts that could potentially identify you. 

## What do we do with the data?
We provide an API for other developers to access the location history of diagnosed corona virus patients. The data can be used to build a helpful tools, for example tracking the spread and estimating areas at risk.

# Developers

Please use our API to get COVID-19 patient's historic location data. Use it ethically to build solutions to help fight the virus. We aim to do one small piece of the puzzle that can be used as a stepping stone to leap frog other develops to build bigger and better apps.
